# JS Assessment

## Quiz Application

The JavaScript code in index.js is unfinished. You will need to study it to figure out what it does. Then you will need to use the existing code and your own, to finish the app.

Complete the following tasks:

1. Calculate the score as the total of the number of correct answers

2. Add an Event listener for the submit button, which will display the score and highlight the correct answers when the button is clicked

3. Reset the page (remove the questions from the UI) when the reset button is clicked (hint: search window.location)

4. Add a countdown timer - when the time is up, end the quiz, display the score and highlight the correct answers

When you have finished, upload your work to GitHub and share the link on Canvas
